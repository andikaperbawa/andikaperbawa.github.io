  (This website is under development)
  
  I am a Postdoctoral fellow in the Ali i. Al-Naimi Petroleum Engineering Research Center at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. My research intersects geophysics, rock physics, geomechanics, and machine learning in understanding rock and fluid interaction in the subsurface. Current study focuses on the impact of carbon dioxide on carbonate rocks during Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) and Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). 
  
  My background as a professional exploration geophysicist in MedcoEnergi is mainly as a seismic interpreter, reservoir characterizationa and geomodeller. My responsibility includes prospect maturation and evaluation, exploration risk assessment, preparing geophysical evaluation for drilling program, post-drill analysis, and resouce calculation.
