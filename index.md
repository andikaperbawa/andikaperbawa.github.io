about_me: |
  I am a Postdoctoral fellow in the Ali i. Al-Naimi Petroleum Engineering Research Center at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
  My research intersects geophysics, rock physics, geomechanics, and machine learning on understanding rock and fluids in the subsurface. Current study focuses on carbon dioxide interaction with carbonate rocks and their implication to Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) and Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). My background as a professional exploration geophysicist in MedcoEnergi (Indonesia oil company) is mainly as seismic interpreter, reservoir characterizationa and geomodeller. My responsibility includes prospect generation, risk assessment, drilling program, post-drill analysis, and plan of development projects.
