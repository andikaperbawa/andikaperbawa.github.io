#- project: Major transitions in individuality

#  description: |
#    Major transitions in individuality redefine what it means to be
#    an individual: formerly independent individuals unite to form a new, more
#    complex lifeform. Examples include the evolution of eukaryotes, multicellularity,
#    and eusocial insect colonies. From a computational perspective, major transitions
#    in individuality result in distributed systems.

#    The goal of this research is to develop a digital model for studying biological
#    evolutionary transitions, allowing us to ask general questions about their dynamics.
#    In the context of evolutionary computation, a system capable of transitions
#    in individuality would be useful for allowing evolution to incrementally build
#    distributed solutions.
#    I am currently working to extend the SignalGP represention to allow co-evolving
#    programs to unite to form hiearchically organized programs.

#    MAP-Elites is an evolutionary computation technique that has proven
#    valuable for exploring and illuminating the genotype-phenotype space of a computational
#    problem. In MAP-Elites, a population is structured based on phenotypic
#    traits of prospective solutions; each cell represents a distinct combination of traits
#    and maintains only the most fit organism found with those traits. The resulting map
#    of trait combinations allows the user to develop a better understanding of how each
#    trait relates to fitness and how traits interact.

#    If we define a MAP-Elites map with traits associated with different aspects
#    of our genetic programming representation (*e.g.*, functions, program length, *etc*.),
#    we can use MAP-Elites as a tool to explore how different aspects of different
#    representations interact across different problems. Are there trade-offs
#    between different aspects of our representation? Are there parts of representation-space
#    that are unlikely to yield solutions? Exploring our GP representations in this
#    way may inform how we configure things such as variation/mutation or selection operators.

#    This project is an ongoing collaboration with fellow devolab student, [Emily Dolson](http://emilyldolson.com).
