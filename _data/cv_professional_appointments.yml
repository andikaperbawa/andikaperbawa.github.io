  description: Performed a research that focused on laboratory rock characterization and imaging of Jurassic carbonate.  Developed a new low-frequency resonant column device and seismic-frequency cyclic-loading apparatus to investigate frequency-dependent (dispersion) velocity and attenuation behavior of intact rocks.  Conducted an integrated study using thin section, CT-scan imaging, surface roughness, X-ray diffraction, physical rock properties measurement and geomechanics triaxial test. My research also involved the characterization of Jurassic carbonate rock reservoir rock from Saudi Arabia and standard rock specimens (Berea sandstone, Indiana limestone, Wisconsin limestone and Eagleford shale.
